# This configuration file tells the test suite which Ruby interpreters to
# test against. Below is an example utilizing RVM.
#
# If you want test coverage reporting via simplecov to work, then this list
# must contain the main Ruby interpreter that you are using, and the entry
# for that Ruby interpreter must execute Ruby through 'bundle exec'. In the
# example below, this is the case for Ruby 1.9.3.

- name: Ruby 1.8.7
  command: rvm-exec ruby-1.8.7-p374 ruby
- name: Ruby 1.9.3
  command: rvm-exec ruby-1.9.3-p551 bundle exec ruby
- name: Ruby 2.1.5
  command: rvm-exec ruby-2.1.5 ruby
- name: Ruby 2.2.0
  command: rvm-exec ruby-2.2.0 ruby
